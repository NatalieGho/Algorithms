This program uses greedy in order to find the optimal solution of the times that TAs will be working in a given day or scheduling time. 

The input of this program is as follows: 
The first line consists of the number of tests 
For each test case, there will be a line starting with a positive integer, which is the number of shifts. The next n lines, which is for how many shifts there are, the input will be a single ordered pair which consists of the start and end time of each shift. 

The output of this program will be a printed out list of all the scheduled intervals that TAs will be available, and each interval will be comma separated.
