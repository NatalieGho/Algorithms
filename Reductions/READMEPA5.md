This program is using Disjoint Vertex and Edge Disjoint paths by utilizing max flow library of networkx.

The input is as follows:
The first line will contain the number of tests
Each test case will use two lines, the first of which is two integers, and one character, which is space separated. The first integer is the number of vertices, and the second integer is the number of edges. The character uses "E" for an edge-disjoint problem or a "V" for a vertex disjoint problem. 
The second line of the test case will contain all the edges, which are space separation. Successive pairs of numbers for an edge between the two respective vertices. 

The output is the number of either edge or vertex disjoint paths. The next however many lines will contain those paths.
