This program uses divide and conquer to determine the most amount of hours that a TA will work if the TAs divide the work. 

This algorithm uses the concept of a binary search in order to cut in half the most possible work that one TA will do in order to finish grading exams. 

The input is as follows: 

The first line consists of the number of tests that are being done.

The second line consists of two integers, the first one of which is the number of shifts, and the second is the number of TAs. 

The third line lists the weights of each shift, each one which is space separated. For the sake of simplicity and sanity, all the edge weights are positive to reflect real life situations and time. 

This continues until all the information for every test case is covered. 

The output of this program/algorithm is the value for the most amount of hours/work that one TA will do.
